        I hope to learn more about the internet, and how websites work. I have always been interested in what is
        happening "under the hood" when I visit a website. <g>I hope to gain more knowledge about the <em>sructure</em>
            of
            websites
            and the <strong>tools</strong> used to make them.</g>
